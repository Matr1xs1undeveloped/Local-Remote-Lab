if you don't see any screen.png file yet that means its fine, the png gets generated once the website is hosted

the background folder you see is for the websites background, you can replace the picture but you have to edit the name again in the index.html and other files. I recommend to copy the name of the current
background picture and replace it with another background if you like. then rename it and paste the name from the previous background so you don't have to rewrite the web file.
